# Getting Started

Welcome to the Tinkr Scripting Platform.

Here you will find documentation for our Lua Scripting API and our Routine Scripting API.

## Custom Scripts

Using the custom scripting API and Lua sandbox, you can create your own utilties, tools, or even complete bots.

## Routines

We also provide a API specficially designed to ease the creation of custom routines (or rotations). Using our API you can create routines that are powerful yet easy to read and write.
